## Results
The results were code that had much faster run times than before. 
## Summary
An advantage of refactoring code is that it makes the code more versatile which allows it to be used for multiple projects. A disadvantage in refactored code is that if there is a defect that does not get caught, the same problematic code could infect other similar projects. An advantage of refactoring this code is that it imporved runtimes and was quicker than starting over. A disadvantage is that the original code was gone as no copy was made.
